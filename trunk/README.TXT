GridStatusHealingReduced is a plugin for Grid, and therefore requires
Grid to be installed and enabled. Grid can be downloaded from:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

Install GridStatusHealingReduced in the Interface/AddOns directory under
your World of Warcraft program directory, as is standard for all addons.

Log into the game and you will find two new statuses available in Grid.
THe "Healing Reduced" status indicates the presence of any debuff which
reduces healing received by some amount. The "Healing Prevented" status
indicates the presence of any debuff which reduces healing received by
100%, effectively preventing healing received.

These statuses are configurable in the usual ways, including color and
priority, and can be placed on any indicator, including those added by
other plugins. Bear in mind that placing one of these statuses on a text
indicator will probably not work very well, unless you have set a very
large frame width.
