Description

	GridStatusHealingReduced adds a status to Grid to show when a unit
	is affected by any debuff which reduces healing taken. It also adds
	a second status for any debuff which prevents healing taken.

Usage

	The statuses added by GridStatusHealingReduced are called "Healing
	Reduced" and "Healing Prevented". They are configurable in all the
	usual ways - such as color and priority - and can be placed on any
	indicator, including those added by other plugins. Configuration is
	available through the Grid options menu.

	itself. The latest version of Grid can be downloaded from:
