## Description

GridStatusHealingReduced adds a status to Grid to show when a unit is
affected by any debuff which reduces healing taken. It also adds a
second status for any debuff which prevents healing taken.


## Usage

The statuses added by GridStatusHealingReduced are called "Healing
Reduced" and "Healing Prevented". They are configurable in all the usual
ways - such as color and priority - and can be placed on any indicator,
including those added by other plugins. Configuration is available
through the Grid options menu.
