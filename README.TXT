
-- INTRODUCTION --------------------------------------------------------

GridStatusHealingReduced is a plugin for Grid which adds one status for
debuffs which reduce the effectiveness of healing taken, and one status
for debuffs which prevent healing taken (reduce healing taken by 100%).

-- INSTALLATION AND USAGE ----------------------------------------------

Install GridStatusHealingReduced as any other addon, in your [[ World of
Warcraft\Interface\AddOns ]] folder. You will then see two new statuses
in Grid's menus: "Healing Prevented" and "Healing Reduced". These can be
customized with regard to color and priority, and may be placed on any
Grid indicator (although placing them on a text indicator is not
recommended, as the full status title will be truncated to something
useless like "Heal" for both statuses depending on your frame width).

-- LOCALIZATION --------------------------------------------------------

GridStatusHealingReduced does not depend on localization to function,
as it recognizes debuffs by their Spell ID. Translations of the status
text labels are present for German, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and
Traditional Chinese; if no translations exist for your locale, English
is used.

-- FEEDBACK ------------------------------------------------------------
