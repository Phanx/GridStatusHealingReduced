Description

	GridStatusHealingReduced adds a status to Grid to show when a unit
	is affected by any debuff which reduces healing taken. It also adds
	a second status for any debuff which prevents healing taken.

Usage

	The statuses added by GridStatusHealingReduced are called "Healing
	Reduced" and "Healing Prevented". They are configurable in all the
	usual ways - such as color and priority - and can be placed on any
	indicator, including those added by other plugins. Configuration is
	available through the Grid options menu.

Dependencies

	GridStatusHealingReduced is a plugin for Grid, and does nothing by
	itself. The latest version of Grid can be downloaded from:
