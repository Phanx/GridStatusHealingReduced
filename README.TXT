Localization:

	Compatible with: all locales.
	Translated into: enUS, deDE, ruRU, koKR, zhCN, zhTW.

Installation and Usage:

	Install GridStatusHealingReduced in the Interface/AddOns directory under
	your World of Warcraft program directory, as is standard for all addons.

	Log into the game and you will find two new statuses available in Grid.
	THe "Healing Reduced" status indicates the presence of any debuff which
	reduces healing received by some amount. The "Healing Prevented" status
	indicates the presence of any debuff which reduces healing received by
	100%, effectively preventing healing received.

	These statuses are configurable in the usual ways, including color and
	priority, and can be placed on any indicator, including those added by
	other plugins. Bear in mind that placing one of these statuses on a text
	indicator will probably not work very well, unless you have set a very
	large frame width.
